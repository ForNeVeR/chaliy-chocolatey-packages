    <summary>Typesafe Activator gets you started with the Typesafe Reactive Platform, Play Framework, Akka and Scala</summary>
    <description>A new addition to the Typesafe Reactive Platform is Typesafe Activator, a unique, browser-based tool that helps developers get started with Typesafe technologies quickly and easily. Activator is a hub for developers wanting to build Reactive applications. Unlike previous developer-focused offerings that are delivered simply via a website, Activator breaks new ground by delivering a rich application directly to the desktop. Activator updates in real-time with new content from Typesafe and value-add third parties, helping developers engage and adopt Typesafe technologies in an entirely frictionless manner.</description>
